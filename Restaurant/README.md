The following programming challenge is from Coursera's Intro in to Front-end Web Development. 

The challenge was to build an online menu for a restaurant called "Little Lemon."

I added the DIV codes, image sources & sizing, and alignment for HTML.

For CSS, I added the color scheme, text alignments and text sizes.

Added bootstrap changes to align page with prices and columns.
